/*
 *  READS PREPROCESSING AND ALIGNMENT
 *  =================================
 *
 *      This script takes in unaligned read groups,
 *      preprocesses them, aligns them to a reference, 
 *      and then marks duplicates. The output of this step
 *      can then be fed into the base recalibration step.
 *
 *      Here we define a *read group* as a single file that
 *      contains reads from a single patient sample. Note that
 *      multiple read groups may correspond to the same patient
 *      sample, if for example the same sample was sequenced
 *      over several runs. The input read groups can be in
 *      fastq pairs or (unmapped) bam format.  
 *
 *      There is an option to specify splitting fastq read groups
 *      across multiple files, which can be passed to the aligner
 *      in parallel to speed up the alignment. After alignment,
 *      the read groups are grouped by patient sample, (into groups
 *      of read groups) and these are merged across runs into
 *      *sample read groups*, where each read group (file of reads)
 *      corresponds to one and only one patient sample.
