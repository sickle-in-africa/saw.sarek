/*
 *  FILTER VARIANTS IN SAMPLE VARIANT SETS
 *  ======================================
 *
 *  This pipeline is to be used after variant calling if you have
 *  called variants in the per-sample mode (i.e. you have not joint-
 *  called the variants across the cohort). 
 *
 *  For joint-called variants the filtering process is more
 *  more complicated, and we provide alternative pipelines for this
 *  task.
