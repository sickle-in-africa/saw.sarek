/*
 *  GET RAW READS QUALITY REPORTS
 *  =============================
 *
 *  This pipeline takes in raw read groups and performs quality
 *  analysis. Specifically we use the tool fastqc to generate quality
 *  reports for each input read group, and then we use the tool
 *  multiqc to merge the reports from each individual read group into
 *  a composite quality report for the whole cohort.
 *
 *  Note that that by "read group" we mean a single unmapped bam file 
 *  or fastq file pair containing a list of paired-end reads. This may
 *  be the set of all reads for a single sample, or it might be one of
 *  of many files corresponding to multiple sequencing runs of the 
 *  same sample.
